# Tic-Tac-Toe-Classification
This project analyzes the Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and compares multiple classification algorithms to identify which model best predicts whether ‘x’ wins a given board configuration.

## Methods Evaluated
The following classification algorithms were tested:

- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was also evaluated using **10-fold cross-validation**.
